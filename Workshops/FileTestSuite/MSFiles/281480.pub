In August 2001 the apogees of the Polar spacecraft and the Cluster constellation were within approximately two hours of each other in the local midnight sector. On August 22, 2001 Polar was crossing the central plasma sheet at L~8 from the south to north. At approximately 0950 UT substorm onset occurred, resulting in an injection of energetic ions and electrons observed by Polar. The Polar satellite then encountered  a series of flux drop-outs and enhancements until 2110 UT. The Cluster satellites traversed nearly the same regions as Polar during this interval but at a much higher altitude. The injection observed by Polar was nearly simultaneous with a sequence of energetic electron and ion bursts detected by Cluster near the magnetotail neutral sheet. Four hours later, a p! ronounced flux drop-out was observed by Polar at the same time as a pronounced decrease in the average particle energy was observed by Cluster, indicating that the plasma sheet thinned, sweeping Cluster into the tail lobe region. We correlate the Cluster energetic ion and electron observations with similar measurements observed by Polar nearly simultaneously on nearby flux tubes, focusing on the particles streaming earthward and tailward along the magnetic field lines. We then use these multi-spacecraft observations to determine the temporal and spatial extent of substorm activity in the magnetotail.
