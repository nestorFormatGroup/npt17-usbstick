* TODO file for Recode

Tell `mailto:recode-bugs@iro.umontreal.ca' if you feel like volunteering
for any of these ideas, listed more or less in decreasing order
of priority.  Some TODO items are implicit within received email.

.* Before next official release
. + SIGSEGV when merged.c is involved
. + recode_string does not always work
. + Memory leaks: see add_to_sequence, ALLOC, recode_{m,re}alloc}.
. + Revise everything about explodes.
. + Update NEWS for latest libiconv and latest Keld tables.
. + Remove TeX edition warnings, rephrase whatever required.
. + Complete inter-node and menu references, as necessary.
. + See make and configure HAVE_UNION_WAIT, see `lr /conf-wait-'.
. + Solaris cc 4.2 with option "-O" miscompiles src/libiconv.c, probably
    the function module_libiconv. The symptom is that
    "src/recode --quiet --force ascii-bs..ebcdic < COPYING > output"
    creates an output file smaller than COPYING. The only known workaround
    is to not use "-O".

.* Keld
. + recode
.  - New tables from Keld
.  - Revise diagnostics
. + Standards aspects
.  - Wait for PostScript
.   : charset in 14652
.   : transliteration in 14652
.   : API in 15435
.   : recoding/iconv APIs (->Handa)
. + Miscellaneous
.  - African tables
.  - Unicode/W3C short-comings
.   : Lithuanian

.* Linus
. @ ~/mÃ©thodes/rtf/

.* Particular notes
. + feuille Tamil
. + Autoconf and DOSWIN
. + New RFC 1345 tables, still some diagnostics
. + Check notes from ORA
. @ ~/libit/rmail/m4
. @ ~/libit/rmail/gettext

.@ ChangeLog

.* Charsets
. + Clean up applemac vs macintosh and ibmpc vs ibm437.
. + Implement RFC1345 more fully.
. + Generalize older charsets (latex, texte, etc.) to RFC 1345 mnemonics.
. + Support VT320 support and related character sets.  (Alain Simon)
. + Support @code{[nt]roff} diacritics.
. + Support Universite de Montreal ``accent'' convention.
. @ ~/entretien/codes/mule/courriel/

.* Surfaces
. + Implement some invbits over 8, 7 or 6 bits, maybe more.
. + CR-LF, in ibmpc.c (implied by IBMPC?)
. + CR, in applemac.c (implied by Apple-Mac?)
. + Message headers [RFC 1342]
. + Mnemonic and Mnemo (maybe?) [RFC 1345]
. + Integrate -c and -g into charsets.
. + Find something for ``recode -g ibmpc:ibmpc`` to do what it suggests
. + Option -M (implying -i) to process MIME headers

.* Mechanics
. + Intercept signals to cleanup the temporary files in any event.
. + Revise --sequence=pipe thoroughly.
. + Rewrite execute_pipe_sequence for having only one child per parent.
. + Revise --force thoroughly.
. + Rewrite .l converses for lat1{asci,ltex,txte}, for --force.
. + Optimize/merge all one-to-many cases.
. + Write a better `make check', not as partial and forgiving.
. + Modify recode so I can get rid of diacrit.[ch] (elsewhere).
. + Have -l know which output charset to use (Martin Maechler, 93-12-07).
. + Take note that ->RFC1345 recodings are non reversible.

.* Notes about MSDOS port
. + I had to `touch stamp-h'.
. + @PRODUCT@ and @VERSION@ were not substituted.
. + Replace PRODUCT by PACKAGE within config_h.*.
. + One should have -DHAVE_CONFIG_H=1 (the `=1' is required).
. + charset.c:637: Maybe incorrect assignment in init_table_for_rfc1345().
. + LIBINTL.OBJ and LOCALE.OBJ were not compiled.
. + Rule to compile LIBINTL.OBJ was missing.
. + readme.tcc should become README.DOS as things go.
