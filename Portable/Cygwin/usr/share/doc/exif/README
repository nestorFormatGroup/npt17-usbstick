				      EXIF
				      ----

'exif' is a small command-line utility to show EXIF information hidden
in JPEG files. I wrote it to demonstrate the power of libexif.

It depends on 
 * libexif (http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/libexif)
 * popt

Have fun!

BUILDING
--------

Assuming libexif and popt are installed, building exif from the source
tar ball should be a simple matter of:

  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install

If your libexif is installed in a non-standard location, you must point
configure at the location of its libexif.pc file using the pkg-config
path, like this:

  ./configure PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig

When building from CVS, run this before configuring:

  autoreconf -i


INTERNATIONALIZATION
--------------------

All translations for exif (except en_CA) are coordinated by the
Translation Project at http://translationproject.org/.  This means
that ALL changes to the .po files (except that exception) MUST be
made through the TP web site, or they will be eventually overwritten
and lost.  If you are interested in translating exif into a new
language, simply join TP and start!  A translation disclaimer is NOT
required for exif; by making a translation, you agree implicitly to
provide it under the same license terms as the rest of exif (GPL).
When a new version of exif is available for translation, an exif
maintainer will contact the Translation Project and all interested TP
members will be automatically notified.
